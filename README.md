Using the "cardio_train.csv" and "diabetes.csv" datasets, the code performs the following:
- 1. Load the "cardio_train.csv" or “diabetes.csv” dataset using Pandas
- 2. Split the data into 80% for training and 20% for testing 
- 3. Train an XG-Boost classifier model using SK-Learn Library
- 4. Assess trained model performance
- 5. Plot the confusion matrix
- 6. Print the classification report
